        <p>

        <h3>Good Catch</h3>
        <p>
          The company's drive to succeed began with baseball. Our founder,
          Donald LeStage, excelled for local clubs in North Attleboro and during
          his college career at Brown University. After receiving professional
          contract offers for his catching services, Donald opted to bring that
          same drive for excellence to the jewelry industry. Established in
          1863, LeStage Manufacturing's guiding principle has always been an
          honest insistence on the highest quality products and the absolute
          best service. And that principle, much like the LeStage familyâ€™s
          connection to fine jewelry, has endured for generations.

      <h4>Attleboro Roots, Cape Cod Spirit</h4>
      <p>
        It started with a phone call from 4th generation owner Matthew LeStage
        to a jeweler on Cape Cod about a bracelet he made laying the foundation
        for what would ultimately become the classic bracelet &amp; brand that
        we know today.
